This app is going to be a simple drawing application that will allow the user to draw pictures, save them, export them, 
and import templates.

ITERATION #1 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

CODE NOTES: 
The '//WORK IN PROGRESS//' header indicates codeblocks or files [if found under the import section] that were started 
but not completed for this iteration. 
WIP files include: TemplatesActivity, RecycleViewAdapter, ourPath, importActivity, GalleryItem, and galleryActivity


TESTING: 
We have successfully implemented testing for the Draw user story.

Unfortunately, due to the drawing library weâ€™re using, we can't use Espresso to test. There are no ways to get 
Espresso readable. 

For the Add a Drawing User Story: 
Espresso has no way to check if a drawing object exists. 

For the Draw User Story: 
The actual drawing action is not recorded and the brush movements are handled internal to the library; 
therefore, we cannot use Espresso to test it. 

For the Erase User Story: 
The actual erase action is not recorded and the eraser movements are handled internal to the library; 
therefore, we cannot use Espresso to test it. 

For the Erasing The Entire Canvas User Story: 
Espresso cannot directly check the contents of the drawing object

We will need Mocking and other more advanced testing methods to implement test for these User Stories.
